**Recommendations**

The profit to sales ratio of this company is decreasing although sales and profit are increasing (2019-2020). An unexpected increase in prices during the Covid-19 can be the reason behind a decreasing profit to sales ratio. 

1.  The company is recommended to focus on enhancing its cost-effectiveness.
2.  They should adopt appropriate marketing strategies to increase the sales of high-profit generating products.
3.  They typically see an increase in revenue in the middle and ending of the year, and thus they are recommended to introduce their promotional schemes in the lean months, espcially in Jan-April.
